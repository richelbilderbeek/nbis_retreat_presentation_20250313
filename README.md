## Changes

It shows we care about quality:

- The documentation is good enough to be used in courses,
  where courses ensure the documentation is kept up-to-date

It shows we care about efficiency:

- The documentation is good enough to solve tickets
  by sending one URL,
  where tickets inspire to improve the documentation

It shows we care about users:

- Uses can create issues,
  which are discussed in the documentation meetings
- Users can submit changes via a Pull Request, 
  which are discussed in the documentation meetings
- Each page has an icon that allows a user to propose changes
- We detect as much mistakes as possible automatically

We know we do a good job:
- When asked if documentation is clear, it usually is.
  - When not, the documentation is updated :-)
- We get compliments from users in courses for having
  such clear documentation
  - Also: people migrating to Dardel complain about
    the PDC documentation
