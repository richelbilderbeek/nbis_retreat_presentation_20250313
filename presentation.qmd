## What it shows 1/3

It shows we care about quality:

-   The documentation is good enough to be used in courses, where courses ensure the documentation is kept up-to-date
-   We detect as much mistakes as possible automatically

## What it shows 2/3

It shows we care about efficiency:

-   The documentation is good enough to solve tickets by sending one URL, where tickets inspire to improve the documentation

## What it shows 3/3

It shows we care about users:

-   We care about quality for them
-   Uses can create issues, which are discussed in the documentation meetings
-   Users can submit changes via a Pull Request, which are discussed in the documentation meetings
-   Each page has an icon that allows a user to propose changes

## What we think

We think we do a good job:

-   When asked if documentation is clear, it usually is.
    -   When not, the documentation is updated :+1:
-   Although there is a place for anonymous feedback on the front page,
    not a single comment has been posted
-   We get compliments from users in courses for having such clear documentation
    -   Also: people migrating to Dardel complain about the PDC documentation :smiley:

## Take home message

Our user documentation shows, that we care about:

-   quality
-   efficiency
-   our users

## The end
